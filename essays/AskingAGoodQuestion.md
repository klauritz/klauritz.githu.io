# Introduction

In the essay called "How to Ask Questions the Smart Way", by Eric Raymond, the author discusses techniques and ettiquette when asking questions on web forums. He discusses what makes a question a 'good' question, and how to avoid asking 'bad' questions.

> \[Good] questions are a stimulus and a gift. Good questions help us develop our understanding, and often reveal problems we might not have noticed or thought about otherwise.

Additionally, he lists what to do before you ask, how to ask the question, and how to handle replies and responses. Using his criteria, I picked out two questions from Stack Overflow. One question is good, and one is bad. I'll discuss why I think they're good or bad, based on what I learned from reading Raymond's essay.
