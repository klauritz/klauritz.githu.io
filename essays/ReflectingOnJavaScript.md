# Introduction

During my Software Engineering course at the Uinversity of Hawaii at Manoa, I had to learn the basics of JavaScript. As a person who has programmed in only C/C++, learning JavaScript was a new and completely interesting topic. Additionally, the way the professor taught the class, and his whole pedigogy, was something I wasn't to. However, both of these differences were pleasant suprises as I found myself completely interested and enjoyed the content I was learning.

# From C to JavaScript

As a Computer Engineering undergraduate, I've been accustomed to the primarily C and C++. I've coded a variety of programs in those languages. Keeping track of variable types? Sometimes annoying but we were told it was a necessary evil. Iterating through arrays? Tedious, but doable. Dynamic memory allocation? Vectors, `malloc()`, and `free()` are all I need. C and C++ seemed old and dusty at times, but i thought that how all languages are. But learning JavaScript has opened my eyes to all sorts of possibilities. Not having to declare a variable type, functions being able to take in any sort of variable, and functions being able to *return an integer **or** a string* just amazed me. Also:

```javascript
for (element of array) {
  // ...
}
```

That right there is why JavaScript is quickly becoming my favorite language. Iterating through arrays in C/C++ was so tedious and complicated. And what I've listed is only just the basics. I look forward to learning what else JavaScript has to offer!

# Athletic Learning

In addition to JavaScript, the difference between this class and other classes I've taken is the way the professor structures the coursework. Workout-of-the-days, or WODs, are mini-problems that we have to solve under a time constraint. They're designed to mimic interview questions when applying to various software positions. I think this is a great way to prepare people for job interviews. I really appreciate the professor doing this, as it prepares me for the real world and helps develop my problem solving skills. The workload feels like a lot, but the work itself feels meaningful and has reason behind it. I enjoy his way of teaching and I wish other professors would do the same.

# Conclusion

It's only been a couple of weeks into the course, but I can tell that I will take away a lot from this class, and it will really show me how to develop software and prepare me for the real world. JavaScript is a pleasure to learn, and athletic learning is a strange, but very welcome change to the way classes are structured. I look forward to learning more from this class.
