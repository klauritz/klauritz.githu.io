## Introduction
  Before we get into what I think about design patterns and how I use them, let me take a moment to introduce what I interpret the term 'design pattern' to mean. A design pattern is a way of doing something that a lot of people can reproduce. Things like material design, or object oriented programming, are both methods of solving a problem. These are design patterns. This essay will discuss what I thihk of common design patterns, as well as specifically what design patterns I have used.

## The Benefits of Design Patterns
  As I learn more about software development, and the process of creating a usable end-product for userbase, I really appreciate looking at how other people solve problems similar to ones that i encounter. However, I noticed that a lot of companies solve things rather similarly. They all use the same techniques to solve a common problem. This, in essence, is a design pattern. Database models, user interface standards, production tools, and even project management ideologies can all be examples of design patterns.
   Picking up on these design patterns can really streamline your development process as you don;t have to reinvent the wheel to solve a problem that most people have already solved. You want to have a neat standardized styling library for your website? Use a CSS framework, or follow Google's Material Design standards. Or maybe you don't know what format you should make your website? Well a common design pattern is the classic navbar/body/footer layout. Design patterns really help everybody make the best product possible by streamlining the best solutions to common problems.
   
## How I Use Design Patterns
  Personally, I deal with a lot of UI/UX problems. At first, I thought it was very overwhelming to make a website look sleek and uniform. I thought to myself, "how does everyone fix the problem of making their website look good?" Well, the answer to that is developers commonly use CSS frameworks! Using this design pattern, I was able to quickly manufacture a UI that satisfied my goals. In the instance where I needed to make a UI/UX without a framework available to me, I used Google's Material Design to create a hassle-free user experience for a mobile app. Taking advantage of these desing patterns saved me a lot of effort, while producing a quality product that I was happy with (and won me almost 300 dollars in the Hawaii Annual Coding Challange!).
  
## Conclusion
  In conclusion, a design pattern is a solution that people can use to solve a common problem. There are a lot of design patterns out there, and finding the right ones for your product can be very powerful. I myself found that following design patterns really boosted my ability in web development and application design!
