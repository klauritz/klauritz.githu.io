summary: A few fellow students and I designed and developed a tool where students across our campus could submit problems/issues that the school should fix on the campus. This way, the authorities can see what issues matter most to students.

# Purpose
A college campus can be very large, with many vending machines, light fixtures, appliances, and sidewalks. Sometimes, these utilities get depricated or break down. The students will notice it almost immediately, since they are the main users of such utilities. However, it may take a long time for the appropriate authorities to catch wind of these issues and move to resolve them. Additionally, these authorities and offices have a difficult time seeing which of these issues actually mean the most to students.

Some students and I took it upon ourselves to create a tool to help students submit these issues, as well as provide a way for authorities see this collection of issues as well as see which issues mean most to the students.

# Features
First, the users are greeted with a landing page, introducing them to the application, as well as providing a summary of the application's many features.

The app's features include:
* user submission for issues, with the ability to submit a description, location, and date.
* user's ability to upvote, downvote, as well as comment
* admininistration accounts with the ability to view, edit, and remove user submissions
* admin accounts can see votes and update progress
* tentative features include geolocation as well as the ability to report, track, and favorite issues

# Personal Contributions
For this project, I dealt primarily with the user interface and user experience of the application. When talking over what we wanted the application to accomplish, I noticed a lot of similarities with reddit. So I used their design pattern to help develop a clean and simple to use user interface.

I also helped with some data modeling and developing the schema for the database for our application. The primary technologies used for this application was Meteor, since it was a platform that can quickly be created, revised, and deployed. 

# Final Thoughts
Although I think this application can be improved, I am happy with what our team made. This project was a great way to practice working with React and Javascript. Since this was my first time making an application using the Meteor framework, it was a very beneficial learning experience!
